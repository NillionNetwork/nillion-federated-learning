# Examples

- Basic Logistic Regression: It uses a mock dataset and a Logistic Regression model. It can serve to test the speed of training and check various model parameters.
- Basic Neural Network: Shows how to build a more complex model, yet simple enough. It uses two consecutive linear layers and a Sigmoid activation.
- Basic Neural Network with 5 parties: Uses 5 parties to train a model on a distributed dataset.
- Convolutional Neural Network: It uses a more complex CIFAR 10 model and permits training on it.
